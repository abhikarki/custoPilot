## custoPilot - AI Native Customer Support Platform  <a href = "https://friendly-spontaneity-production.up.railway.app/login"> visit site </a>
A customer support platform that enables companies to build, train, and deploy AI chatbots using their own internal knowledge while keeping humans in the loop when needed. The platform supports uploading any unstructured knowledge, which is handled by agents in the **knowledge ingestion pipeline** (as shown in the architecture diagram). These agents process, structure, and store the data in a format optimized for use during customer conversations.

The **Chatbot Builder** allows teams to create custom chatbots by selecting specific documents (uploaded knowledge) for different use cases. Once a chatbot is built, it can be tested in a sandbox environment that mirrors real customer interactions. The chatbot can then be embedded directly into the company’s website using a lightweight script generated by the platform.

Post-production, companies can use the **support console** to monitor conversations, view usage analytics, and receive human escalation requests via MCP tools when AI agents in the **customer support pipeline** determine they are not confident enough to respond.
